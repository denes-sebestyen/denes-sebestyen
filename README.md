- 👋 Hi, I’m Dénes Sebestyén (@denes-sebestyen), nickname is Sebi
- 👀 I’m interested in every aspect of programming and computer science, also in robotics, hardware.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everzthing I need in what I'm doing. That's constant learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that needs thinking, I'm good at seeing the big picture, and digging for the root cause of a problem.
- 📫 How to reach me denes.j.sebestyeN@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: when I joined elementary school, I already knew how to read and write, because my father bought a ZX81 when I was little, and if I wanted to play with anything on it, I had to type in the program from a paper.
